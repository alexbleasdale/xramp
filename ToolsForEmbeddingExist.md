# Introduction #

At the moment, we have some basic code and unit tests.  The SVN repository contains the current project state for those interested in taking a more in-depth look at the code.  This is under fairly regular development; mostly dependent on how many other things I have on at any given time ;)

# Details #

Currently the app (and unit tests) demonstrate how to configure an embedded eXist instance into your project and utilise some common tools to deal with the following:

  * Starting and stopping an embedded eXist instance
  * Adding collections to an embedded eXist instance
  * Adding and retrieving documents from that particular embedded eXist instance
